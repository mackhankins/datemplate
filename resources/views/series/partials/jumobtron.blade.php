            The Evers (Medgar Wiley and Myrlie Beasley) Papers include Evers and Beasley family papers and photographs dating from the early 1900s to around July 1964, when Myrlie Evers and her children moved to Claremont, California. The papers document the activities and interests of Medgar Evers and his wife, Myrlie Evers; their children, Darrell Kenyatta Evers, Reena Denise Evers, and James Van Dyke Evers; as well as other Evers and Beasley family members and friends living in Decatur, Jackson, or Vicksburg, Mississippi, from the early 1900s to the early 1960s. The series scanned and available below are primarily Medgar Evers's NAACP records and Evers family photographs; other series may be viewed in the Winter Building Archival Reading Room. Images can be accessed through keyword search or by browsing within each series, as they become available, and are limited to use in the William F. Winter Building Media Room due to copyright restrictions.
